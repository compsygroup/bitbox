# About

## About

Bitbox is an easy-to-use computational toolbox to fill the gap between engineering advances in AI and their accessibility by behavioral scientists for quantifying nonverbal human behavior. While numerous successful computational approaches for quantifying human behavior from videos exist, their use is nearly always restricted to specialized engineers, rendering computational behavior analysis out of reach for those most interested in studying human behavior— behavioral, social, and medical scientists. The main goal of Bitbox is to provide computational tools that researchers with no engineering background can use and interpret, to democratize computational behavior analysis and significantly advance science in this area. The sophisticated design of Bitbox, as well as its state-of-the-art algorithms, make it a valuable tool for engineers and computer vision researchers as well. Moreover, its modular architecture makes it easy for developers to contribute their algorithms.

### Team

Bitbox is being developed at Children’s Hospital Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. The core development team consists of computational scientists and engineers, psychologists and behavioral scientists, and software developers, who design, develop, implement, test, and document all tools in collaboration.

# Bitbox Developer Documentation

Welcome to the developer docs. This is the companion to the user guides, aimed at contributors who want to understand and extend the Bitbox API.

## What's inside

- A quick orientation so you know how the site is structured.
- A short guide on running and hot-reloading the docs locally.
- API reference pages that stay in sync with the code under `src/bitbox` via live docstrings.

When you add new modules or functions, document them with clear docstrings and add them to the navigation; the reference will pick them up automatically.

## Development

Bitbox is developed at Children’s Hospital Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania by a team of computational scientists, behavioral scientists, and engineers working together on design, implementation, testing, and documentation.

# Standalone Mode

<h2 align="center">Standalone Mode</h2>

To run Bitbox on a single computer, install both the backend processors and our Python library on that computer. See the installation guide for further details. **A NVIDIA GPU must be present on that computer.**

### **Pointing to Backend Processors**

Once the installation is complete, configure the Python library to connect with the backend processors. The simplest method is to utilize our Docker image and assign the image name to the `runtime` parameter.

```python
# define a face processor and tell where the backend is located
processor = FP(runtime='bitbox:latest')
```

If you installed the backend processor natively, you can specify the installation directory.

```python
# define a face processor and tell where the backend is located
processor = FP(runtime='/path/to/backend/bin')
```

To avoid setting the `runtime` every time you write a script, you can set the system environment variable in your local profile.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Mac / Linux" %}
```bash
export BITBOX_DOCKER=bitbox:latest # if you want to use our Docker image
export BITBOX_3DI=/path/to/3DI/bin # if you installed 3DI natively
export BITBOX_3DI_LITE=/path/to/3DI-lite/bin # if you installed 3DI-lite natively
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
```powershell
set BITBOX_DOCKER=bitbox:latest # if you want to use our Docker image
set BITBOX_3DI=C:\path\to\3DI\bin # if you installed 3DI natively
set BITBOX_3DI_LITE=C:\path\to\3DI-lite\bin # if you installed 3DI-lite natively
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

When the `BITBOX_DOCKER` environment variable is set, other environment variables are ignored. Meanwhile, setting the `runtime` parameter will disregard all environment variables, including `BITBOX_DOCKER`.

### Pointing to Files

Define local input files and output directories using absolute or relative paths.

```python
# define input file and output directory
input_file = 'data/elaine.mp4'
output_dir = 'output'
```

The output directory, if it doesn't already exist, will be automatically created. All files generated by the backend processor will be stored in this directory. Bitbox will monitor this directory for file caching; refer to our [documentation](../overview/output-formats.md#file-caching-system) for more details on file caching.

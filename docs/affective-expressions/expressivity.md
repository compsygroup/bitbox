# Expressivity

<h2 align="center">Overall Expressivity</h2>

Bitbox measures overall expressivity of expressions by counting number of activations of expression signals, their magnitudes, ranges, etc. These stats can be used to study how expressive a face is on average. These metrics are also useful as covariates as certain other measures, such as [asymmetry](symmetry.md), can be affected by overall expressivity (higher range of expressions may lead to higher magnitudes of asymmetry).&#x20;

This function only accepts [global](localized-expression-units.md#expression-related-global-deformations) or [local](localized-expression-units.md#localized-expression-units) facial expressions. It computes expressivity stats for each  expression coefficient independently.&#x20;

```python
from bitbox.expressions import expressivity

# estimate global expression coefficients
exp_global, pose, lands3D = processor.fit()

# compute expressivity stats
expressivity_stats = expressivity(exp_global)
```

The output is a list of Pandas `DataFrame` including five asymmetry scores per frame: _eyes_, _brows_, _nose_, _mouth_, and _overall_.

### Output Ranges

Bitbox performs a straightforward normalization on the asymmetry scores, by default. For 3D landmarks, the values typically fall between 0 (guaranteed) and 1 (not guaranteed). For 2D landmarks, the values are guaranteed to start from 0, but the upper limit is unspecified.

{% hint style="info" %}
When interpreting normalized scores for 3D landmarks, use these as rough, human-visible thresholds:

* Eyes: > 0.20 ≈ noticeable; > 0.40 ≈ clearly asymmetric
* Brows: > 0.35 ≈ noticeable; > 0.40 ≈ clearly asymmetric
* Nose: > 0.10 ≈ noticeable; > 0.40 ≈ clearly asymmetric
* Mouth: > 0.10 ≈ noticeable; > 0.40 ≈ clearly asymmetric

These are recommendations, not rules. Adjust them to your data and use case.

With 2D landmarks, no universal thresholds exist as scale and camera effects vary. Calibrate on your dataset.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Score values may change based on the backend processor used to generate landmark coordinates. For example, 3D landmarks generated by 3DI-Lite, on average, tend to yield lower asymmetry score. Thresholds listed above are for 3D landmarks generated by 3DI.
{% endhint %}

Disable normalization to compute scores in the same units as the landmarks.

# Diversity

<h2 align="center">Expression Diversity</h2>

Bitbox quantifies diversity of expression-related activations by computing the entropy of those activations. If a person activates only certain types of expression signals, and not the others, entropy is small.&#x20;

This function only accepts [global](facial-expressions.md#expression-related-global-deformations) or [local](facial-expressions.md#localized-expression-units) facial expressions. It computes diversity over all expression coefficients together and generate a single score for the entire video, as well as a score for the average frame-wise entropy.&#x20;

```python
from bitbox.expressions import diversity

# estimate global expression coefficients
exp_global, pose, lands3D = processor.fit()

# compute expressivity stats
diversity_scores = diversity(exp_global, scales=6)
```

The computation is performed at several temporal scales, similar to multiscale computations with [Expressivity](expressivity.md#temporal-scales). Multiscale computation allows capturing expressions that unfold at different speedsâ€”for example, slow, moderate, or rapid changes in facial activity. A temporal scale represents the approximate duration of an expression event. For instance, if the scale is 1 second, the algorithm looks for activations (peaks) in the expression signal that last about one second from start to finish. At each scale, a peak detection algorithm identifies these activations, and the entrpopy is computed using peak frequencies. Please see [Expressivity](expressivity.md#temporal-scales) section for the details on temporal scales.&#x20;

The output is a Pandas `DataFrame`, containing two scores per temporal scale: overall entropy and average frame-wise entropy.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Overall**: Number of activations (peaks) observed in the expression signal.

**Frame-wise**: Cummulative sum of activation magnitudes divided by the signal length.
{% endhint %}
